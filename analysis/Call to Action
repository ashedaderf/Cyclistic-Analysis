Now that we analyzed different parts of the dataset, the final conclusion I can make based on the analysis is that casual riders are more likely to use the bikes on the weekends and around 8am or 5pm. 

Recommendations:
-The advertising and marketing team should create deals where there are subscriptions for just the mornings for people who like to exercise and use Cyclistic bikes as a mode of cardio. 
-There could be a subscription that allows Cyclistic bikes to be used exclusively on the weekends when casual riders peak usage throughout the week.
